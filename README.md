# Android WeatherHelper Prototype

This prototype shows how to implement a humidity and temperature monitor using Bluetooth comunication between two Android device and Arduino, using
all the fundamental Bluetooth API capabilities.

It was develop as a personal work of my Computer Engineer course at UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DO PAR√Å (UFPA) .

# Introduction


This prototype should be run on Android devices and Arduino Uno, to establish working app. Select "Made discoverable" in Arduino, I'm used DHT22 Sensor to get humidity and temperarure measured, and click
on the Bluetooth icon on the devide, to find the device and establish the connection.

A Prototype climate management system(CMS) controlled by mobile device through an app. 
Developed  by integrating Android Studio and Arduino platform, 
o CMS consist to a system that is not just weather monitor(humidity and temperature) 
but specially to direct the user to take preventive measures 
by describing that to the user in case the climatic variable changes have been a nocive level to the user.
